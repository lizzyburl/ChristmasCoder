ChristmasCoder
==============

My riddle for my brother for Christmas to decode which Christmas gift is his.

Basically, my family likes to code Christmas gifts instead of actually writing whose name is who. 
I made this encoder which will "encode" a message to be shaped like a tree. In the example, the message is simply a string of A's.
There is a displacement that increments by 1 each position. Therefore, all a's simply becomes the alphabet.
